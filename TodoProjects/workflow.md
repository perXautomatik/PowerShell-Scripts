workflow

code is in a current state

i drop it because i'm done or bored or reached a to hard state

i get an idea, and want to modify or continue code.

assosisate that change to my current idea.

that is, create a new "project" a not to serious work surface that basicly just remmeber what you're doing as long as you have the program open.

should be a new branch now when i think about it, quit simply nothing else.
