# PSEverything
PowerShell cmdlet for the local search engine Everything

_Everything_ is a blazingly fast local search engine by David Carpenter, found at http://www.voidtools.com/

To use it, download Everything and install it as a service.

Install PSEverything from PowerShell Gallery.


Install-Module PSEverything


Then you can so things like

Search-Everything -Extension cpp,h -FilePattern Bytes | Get-Item

That almost instantly finds all cpp and h files with Bytes in it's name on all NTFS drives.

On my system,

Search-Everything -ext h

returned 61082 '.h' files in 344 ms.
